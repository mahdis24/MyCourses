Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: when N is bigger than 10000, there are some teams that have 0% chance to win, and i think they are incorrect!

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: i prefer 10000
