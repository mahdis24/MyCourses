According to the data extracted from the database,
if the energy level for a person is high, that person can be interested in trance or sports songs,
and if the loudness level is high, that person is interested in calm and relaxing songs.
and other analyzes similar to those mentioned above!

In my opinion, paying attention to only one of the indicators,
or paying attention to several of them separately,
cannot really express what kind of musical taste the user has.
An algorithm should be developed that is based on a combination of considering all these indicatorsÙˆ
and can analyze the user's musical taste.
